excerpt: Met a local shopkeeper, and made and apron.
---

I popped into a small clothing shop in my town on a slow day and met the owner. The shop is an outlet for a bigger brand, and the brand is going zero-waste, so they send over the off-cuts and bolt-ends and this shop makes totes and handbags and stuff in-house. I asked the owner if I could buy some of the scraps. She said no, but that she would give me some un-dyed denim for free on the condition that I come back and show her what I made. I made an apron.
I grew up in the suburbs but live in a small town now. I have these types of interactions all the time now and its so nice.
