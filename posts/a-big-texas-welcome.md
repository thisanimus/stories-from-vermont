excerpt: After 3 years in an adoption queue, we just got matched! We adopted our daughter last Monday, and we want our Texas friends and family to share in our joy!

Howdy! Last Monday we adopted our baby girl! We have received so much love, care, and prayer from y'all down here in Texas, and we want to be sure you have an opportunity to meet Natalie before we begin our drive home to Vermont on Thursday.

We will have a come-and-go meet and greet on Tuesday evening at Keith and Cathy Hale's house in Grapevine. It's not a "shower", men are invited too.

#### Where

1068 W. Winding Creek Drive Grapevine, TX 76051

#### When

Tuesday March 21st, 2023 | 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm

#### Gifts

Gifts are optional, so please feel no obligation. If you'd like to give Natalie a gift, gift cards from Walmart, Target, or Amazon would be best. We will be driving back to Vermont in a sedan with limited storage space, so packing physical gifts would present a challenge.

#### Questions

Contact Cathy Hale [(817) 939-6501](tel:8179396501) / [cathysue.h@gmail.com](mailto:cathysue.h@gmail.com)
