Having journeyed far from the faithful and familiar who surrounded us in our youth, I intend to make good on my many promises to stay in touch.  Since childhood I've desired a life outside Dallas' burgeoning 'burbs.  Because of this, my estimation of this world beyond is tinged with the painfully romantic light of adolescent longing. Reader beware. 

As C and I venture forward, I want to keep you all informed, not so much of the facts of our life together but rather our experience of it.  I'll leave it to you to infer the mundanities.  I eagerly anticipate the joys and challenges of living in Vermont, and at the same time I want to honor my birthplace Texas.  So to unify the two, and as an homage to the great raconteur W. F. Strong:

These are stories from Vermont. 

Some of them are true.
